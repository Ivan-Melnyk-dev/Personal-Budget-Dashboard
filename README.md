# 🧾 Personal Budget Dashboard (Excel)

An interactive personal finance dashboard built in **Microsoft Excel** to analyze monthly income, expenses, bills, savings, and overall cash flow.  
This project helped me strengthen my skills in **data cleaning, KPI modeling, financial analytics, and dashboard design**.

## 🎯 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to create a clear and practical **monthly budget dashboard** that improves financial visibility and supports better decision-making.

Key objectives:

## 📂 Dataset Used

The dataset contains manually prepared monthly financial information:

- Income sources  
- Expense categories  
- Savings allocations
